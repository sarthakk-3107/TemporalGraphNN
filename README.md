ðŸ«€ Temporal Graph Neural Network for Heart Disease Prediction
ðŸ“˜ Overview


This project implements a Temporal Graph Neural Network (TGN) using PyTorch Geometric to model evolving relationships among patients and clinical features. The model predicts heart disease progression by leveraging temporal dependencies and relational structures in Electronic Health Record (EHR) data.

ðŸ§  Key Features
Temporal modeling of patient states using TGN memory modules.
Graph construction from heterogeneous EHR data (ECG, cholesterol, blood pressure, BMI, glucose).
GPU-optimized training for large temporal graphs.
Evaluation using AUC-ROC, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
Comparative analysis with Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Temporal CNNs.
